report: 

The state of my submission is not the best. USPSV1 is in working order and compiles sucessfully and runs the
 arguments from stdin and from files. It also frees the memory allocated for the array that I created for the 
 program and arguments using a char ***array. USPSV2 is in somewhat working order, however, I cannot figure out 
 how to send a signal back to the processes after forking all the processes and having the child processes 
 wait. I was using pause() in order to stop the child processes but I could not understand how to efficietly 
 send a signal back to the children to start executing. USPSV3 and USPV4 are both not in working order and have been barely even touched as I could not wrap my mind around the system calls.
